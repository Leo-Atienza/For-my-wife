# For My Wife

Hey love,

I built this app for us.
It is my little digital space where I can keep loving you in all the small daily ways, even when life gets busy or we are apart.

## What This App Is

This is our private couple app, built with Expo + React Native and powered by Supabase sync.
It keeps our memories, notes, milestones, moods, plans, and tiny daily moments in one place.

## What You Can Do Here

- Send and save love notes
- Save memories with photos
- Track countdowns (next visit, anniversaries, special days)
- Build a bucket list and wish list together
- Keep a relationship timeline of milestones
- Share moods and "thinking of you" taps
- Use partner notes, promises, and dream tracking
- Add date ideas, songs, greetings, and journal letters
- Answer fun prompts like quizzes and would-you-rather
- Explore love language tips, recap stats, and relationship widgets
- Watch live sync between partners with notifications for important moments

## Why I Made It

Because I want us to have a home for our story.
Not just photos and chats, but a place where our relationship grows on purpose.
Every feature here was made to help me show up for you better.

## Tech Stack

## Note

This project is deeply personal.
It was built with love, intention, and way too many late-night ideas about us.
